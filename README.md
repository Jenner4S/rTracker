# rTracker

rTracker is a complete iOS application for creating local on-device databases ('trackers') to log data with timestamps.

Trackers can use a variety of iOS controls (number/text fields, sliders, radiobuttons, checkbuttons), and can implement limited functions on values within entries and over time.

Tracker data can be exported in CSV format, and trackers (with or without data) can be shared with other rTracker users.  CSV data may also be imported, and trackers can be created with (specially formatted) CSV files.

Trackers can have iOS local notifications which trigger on specific time and data criteria, implementing a 'reminder to track' facility.

rTracker supports URL schemes to either open the application main window (rTracker://) or a specific tracker (rTracker://tid=4).

A rudimentary privacy facility is available, such that trackers and/or their values can be hidden until a 'graphical password' is entered.

## Status

rTracker is available on the Apple App Store (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rtracker-track-it-all-your-way/id486541371?mt=8&uo=4).  Released as open source because programming is fun, but filing company paperwork is not.
