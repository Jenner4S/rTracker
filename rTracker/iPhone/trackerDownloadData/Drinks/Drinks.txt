The Drinks tracker is a simple log for caffeinated and alcoholic drinks
consumption, and computes daily caffeine, daily alcohol and weekly
alcohol intake.  Just tap the checkbox and save for each drink throughout 
the day.
<p>
If these aren't your usual drinks, pick your own and modify the tracker to 
match your preferences.  Choice is what rTracker is all about.
