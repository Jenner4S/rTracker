Here's an example of a tracker to log time spent on a task such as  a consultant might use, and like all the rTracker samples it's simple to modify for your own needs.
<p>
This tracker implements a system for monitoring
time spent on something and getting it into a spreadsheet.  Like
the <a href="/cgi-bin/bin/gst.pl?t=Sleep">Sleep</a> tracker, the 'start' and 'stop' checkboxes are used in
calculating the 'total hours' function shown at the bottom.  The expenses field is summed for all entries between the 'start' and 'stop' records, and the 'total charge' function includes an hourly rate as a constant.
<p>
If your task falls into only a few categories, the choice buttons work
well for quick access.  If you have lots of tasks and need to add
more as time goes on, the textbox works well because you can use the
history facility to quickly re-enter previous task names or add new
ones as needed.
      <p>
CSV data for this tracker looks like:
       <p>
      <pre style="font-size: 11px;">
"timestamp","start","stop","task notes","expenses","job ID","total hours","total expenses","total charge"
"1 August 2014 09:16:00 BST","1","","","","Job 4","","",""
"1 August 2014 10:18:00 BST","","","Tool rent","7.50","Job 4","","",""
"1 August 2014 17:20:00 BST","","1","Tool rent","18.00","Job 4","8.07","25.50","383.33"
      </pre>
