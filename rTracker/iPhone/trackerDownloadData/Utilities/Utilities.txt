If you want to reduce your energy usage, the place to start is with a clear understanding of
your current consumption levels and how they vary.  With this baseline, you can see the effects
of your actions and the changes you make.

This tracker is the one I personally use in England, so it incorporates conversion factors for cubic
meters of natural gas to kilowatt-hours and the prices per kilowatt-hour charged by my supplier.
We have a wood-burning stove, so I make a note when I use it - but I removed the 'average fires per day' trace from
the graph below for clarity.

Tracker configuration and customization are the design goals of <a href="/cgi-bin/rTracker/iPhone/rTracker-main.pl">rTracker</a>, so creating the specific utilities
tracker for your local needs is simple.  With rTracker installed, click <a href="/rTracker/iPhone/trackerDownloadData/Utilities/Utilities.rtrk">Download Utilities.rtrk</a>
on your iOS device (iPhone) to install this tracker, then click <a href="/rTracker/iPhone/QandA/editTracker.html">'edit'</a> and make it work for you.

Combining rTracker data with a lot of thinking and hard work, our household electricity usage is now 1/7 (one seventh)
what it was over the months after we first moved in.  Last winter our gas usage was 1/5 (one fifth) what it was
during that first winter.  Result!
