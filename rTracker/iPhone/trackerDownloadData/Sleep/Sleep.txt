To sleep better, you need to understand how you sleep over time and
what affects that pattern.  To use this tracker, tap the first checkbox and save
when you go to bed.  Tap the second checkbox when you get up, evaluate
your sleep experience with the other controls, and save.  If you
forget, you can always go back and add or edit the data with the
timestamp you want.  
<p> 
Scrolling down from the values shown in this
screenshot are functions calculating the number of hours resting, a 'sleep
score', and your average resting hours per night over the last month.  
<p>
You may have your own sleep features to capture.  That flexibility is 
exactly what rTracker is designed to handle, so you can customize any of 
these trackers to log just what you want.
