Most exercise trackers are designed to track what their developer
thought you would be interested in; <b>rTracker does not have this limitation</b>.
 rTracker is about creating trackers for the values you are interested in - laps, heart rate, rope skips,
distance - your <b>exact</b> fitness regimen.
<p>
In this example, heart rate is logged at
four different points to enable exploring ranges and transitions as
exercise progresses. Your exercise -- or exercise machine(s) --
may report still more parameters that are trackworthy and waiting to
be watched over time.  rTracker can handle the parameters you want.
<p>
One measure of exercise effectiveness is how quickly your pulse returns to 
normal.  Can you improve that result?
