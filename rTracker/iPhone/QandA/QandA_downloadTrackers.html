      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The key feature and design
principle behind rTracker is that it can be configured to track the
things <span style="font-weight: bold;">you</span> care about.&nbsp;
Below are some pre-made trackers to give you some ideas to get started,
or maybe just go ahead and use as they are already.<br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Sleep tracker</span><br>
      <br>
    To sleep better, you need to understand how you sleep over time and
what affects that pattern.  To use this tracker, tap the first checkbox and save
when you go to bed.  Tap the second checkbox when you get up, evaluate
your sleep experience with the other controls, and save.  If you
forget, you can always go back and add or edit the data with the
timestamp you want.  
<p> 
Scrolling down from the values shown in this
screenshot are functions calculating the number of hours resting, a 'sleep
score', and your average resting hours per night over the last month.  
<p>
You may have your own sleep features to capture.  That flexibility is 
exactly what rTracker is designed to handle, so you can customize any of 
these trackers to log just what you want.

    How <span style="font-weight: bold;">are</span> you today? Right
now?  How would you capture your changes in mood and feelings
throughout the day?  rTracker can handle the concepts that you want to measure.
<p>
Mood tracking is sensitive to set and setting, so to get a realistic view over time we need readings when they're not expected.  The Self tracker uses rTracker's <a href="../QandA/reminder.html">reminders</a>
functionality to query mood at six random times throughout the day to solve this problem.
<p>
Once upon a time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythms">Biorhythms</a> were
believed by many to influence our daily lives.  Does your
experience of life follow any patterns?  More importantly, can you
influence those patterns for the better?   Track and find out.

    Ever have friends over for dinner and worry that you might have served
the same dish last time?  Yes lasagne is an easy dish to make for
a group of people, but don't start them thinking you don't know how to
make anything else! 
<p>
Use this tracker for all your events and keep your friends
coming.  The values shown in the graph are the number of lines in
each textbox -- so it tracks your social life as well.

      <br>
      Here's an example of a tracker to log time spent on a task such as  a consultant might use, and like all the rTracker samples it's simple to modify for your own needs.
<p>
This tracker implements a system for monitoring
time spent on something and getting it into a spreadsheet.  Like
the <a href="/cgi-bin/bin/gst.pl?t=Sleep">Sleep</a> tracker, the 'start' and 'stop' checkboxes are used in
calculating the 'total hours' function shown at the bottom.  The expenses field is summed for all entries between the 'start' and 'stop' records, and the 'total charge' function includes an hourly rate as a constant.
<p>
If your task falls into only a few categories, the choice buttons work
well for quick access.  If you have lots of tasks and need to add
more as time goes on, the textbox works well because you can use the
history facility to quickly re-enter previous task names or add new
ones as needed.
      <p>
CSV data for this tracker looks like:
       <p>
      <pre style="font-size: 11px;">
"timestamp","start","stop","task notes","expenses","job ID","total hours","total expenses","total charge"
"1 August 2014 09:16:00 BST","1","","","","Job 4","","",""
"1 August 2014 10:18:00 BST","","","Tool rent","7.50","Job 4","","",""
"1 August 2014 17:20:00 BST","","1","Tool rent","18.00","Job 4","8.07","25.50","383.33"
      </pre>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Car tracker</span><br>
      <br>
      The Car tracker is included as standard when you buy rTracker, but this is my own personal version reporting costs and distance over months and years.
Install this version and it will merge with the default Car tracker and show your data in a new light!  Please <b>back-up your data first</b>, for example by sending yourself the CSV data file.
<p>
Car mileage is an obvious example for personal data tracking,
especially because it is a key indicator of the overall health of your
vehicle.  Put in the total fuel and total cost readings from
the pump, and tick the '<span style="font-style: italic;">tank full</span>'
checkbox to activate the mileage function calculation.
<p>
This rTracker example shows the use of the '<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Start with last saved value'</span> option
on the odometer value; this way you will usually only need to change
the last few digits of this number when entering data for a
fill-up.  
<p>
In the Car tracker,
the total distance travelled and price per unit are calculated and
logged.  I use the 'total cost' field to log service expenses as well, and the 'notes' item is a full textbox -- perfect for logging longer trips, 
service details, or other issues that will help in understanding your car's 
performance over time.
<p>
With rTracker's flexibility, it is easy to add a conversion for 'miles per 
gallon' or similar if the fuel pumps in your country report litres.

 style="font-weight: bold;">Drinks tracker</span><br>
      <br>
The Drinks tracker is a simple log for caffeinated and alcoholic drinks
consumption, and computes daily caffeine, daily alcohol and weekly
alcohol intake.  Just tap the checkbox and save for each drink throughout 
the day.
<p>
If these aren't your usual drinks, pick your own and modify the tracker to 
match your preferences.  Choice is what rTracker is all about.

 style="font-weight: bold;">Exercise tracker</span><br>
      <br>
Most exercise trackers are designed to track what their developer
thought you would be interested in; <b>rTracker does not have this limitation</b>.
 rTracker is about creating trackers for the values you are interested in - laps, heart rate, rope skips,
distance - your <b>exact</b> fitness regimen.
<p>
In this example, heart rate is logged at
four different points to enable exploring ranges and transitions as
exercise progresses. Your exercise -- or exercise machine(s) --
may report still more parameters that are trackworthy and waiting to
be watched over time.  rTracker can handle the parameters you want.
<p>
One measure of exercise effectiveness is how quickly your pulse returns to 
normal.  Can you improve that result?

 style="font-weight: bold;">Finances tracker</span><br>
      <br>
This tracker maintains a simple categorization of spending, but still enough to see where your
money's going.
<p>
My own personal version includes several bank account balances, but you won't see them because those items are hidden from normal view by a <a href="../QandA/usePrivacy.html">privacy</a> setting.
<p>
Create the finance tracker that fits your exact needs with rTracker.
