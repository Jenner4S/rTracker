  - moved to macbook pro, though not ssd yet.
  - after refactoring and migrating svn repository, privacy subview working again
  - fixed bug in re-ordering valobjs in a tracker, must check if toRow > array count
  - bug in fn defn, somehow not updating ep ids? ... should add to updateVORefs, recheck also fn setup fix for crash 13/01

02 feb 2011
  - can draw privacy view, tictacview
  - shifted line drawing routine defns to gfx.h
  - added this file to scm

02 mar 2011
  - set, change privacy val all in place, not yet used by tracker display
  
--- check in ---

11 mar -plane to uk-
  - initial export xls working, can open file and write data for each tracker and valobj
  - privacy view restriction implemented for both tracker and value level
  
--- check in ---

21 Mar 2011
  - switch to xcode 4
  - instead of .xls implement .csv
  - moved export button from configTList to useTracker when save not pending
  - minor refactoring to fix 'analyze' issues

22 Mar 2011
  - refactored so access of vo.value triggers [vos update] causing function update, result string set
  - initial csv output working, need to check formatting for input

23 Mar 2011
  - testing, minor bug fixes

24 Mar 2011
  - found bug where fn ep not set to default after load, refactored to make vos' handle clean and set default for optdict
  - optdict defaults now handled in voState objs
  - added voState update(), only active for fn to re-calc .value on read

25 Mar 2011
  - factored out doc, db path creation to (new) rtracker-resource.m
  - option on del tracker to just del data
  - added CSVParser class from Matt Gallagher
  - csv input working -- can't yet save/restore schema
  - default privacy = 1 or can't differentiate priv=0 / not found on load csv
  - TrkrData store min privacy level for date valobjs
  - trying to fix flicker on updatetableview; fixed choice ok, slider broken

26 Mar 2011
  - reverted flicker changes (*check in more often!!*) except for choice 
  - show historical actively would not have enable checkbox on slider, choice; why not? changed

--- check in ---

26 Mar 2011
  - rationalize min/max/big/default privacy values. min for tictac setting is MINPRIV+1

28 Mar 2011
  - flicker fix is to not re-alloc vo displays constantly; fixed messed up slider to get spurious val=0 actions on table reload data
  - changed table reloadData for val changed to just reload fn cells
  - tweak display of slider value for checkbox dis/enable
  - choice value +1 so disabled=0, all selections are positive value
  - voNumber startwithlast picks previous entry by current tracker date, not just last by date
  - start cleaning up NSLog's - need #if debug control

30 Mar 2011
  - tracked down problem in slider to check for useVO on [update], caused wipe of data to set useVO
  + need to clean up either enableVO/disableVO everywhere, or get rid of unused checkbuttonusevo

--- check in ---

  - fixed a memory leak - setVtypes
  + need way to control debug NSLog()s but only option seems to be #if DEBUG wrappers...

31 Mar 2011
  - converted all NSLog to #if DEBUG... controlled 

--- check in ---

09 April 2011
  - error because choice value +1 => not voDisplay'd correctly : added getSegmentIndexForValue routine
  --> bug appearance was all subviews buggered after segmentedControl set to invalid index
  - further complexity: UIControlEventValueCHanged gen'd when val set, not just when user activates -- but slider not this way!
  - privacy cancel from setpass triggered toptf resignfirstresponder, same as setp -> set pass to ""; fixed by rewrite setp, cancelp
  - assuming not null autoscale (= not default) meant errors in graph scale - fixed -- TODO: search for more of these

10 April 2011
  - fixed problem shrinking choice buttons, width was reset when style set.  TODO: seg control needs to be centered in subview in this case

--- check in ---

13 April 2011
  - fixed crash on delete new vo in new tracker - tdb=null
  - fixed bug where kybd notification listen turned on/off in configtvobjvc viewDid(Un)load -- switched to viewWill(Dis)Appear -- so was handling in 2 places
  - moved keyboardIsShown to rtracker-resource so just 1

--- check in ---

13 April 2011
  - fixed bug not clearing text field for number entry if val == @""

14 April 2011
  - fixed bug fnCalcValueFromCurrent post-inc ndx on read, inc again if process token for value so missed + in 's + s2'

--- check in ---

27 April 2011
  - (previous) comments, work out pre/post/sum workings
  - fix problem deleting vo from tracker that had no data stored (e.g. function)
  - add code to not load csv data for calculated function value

29 April 2011
  - working on shifting transformVO's into voState's from graphTrackerV, then get voFunction to set its values[]

04 May 2011
  - changed saveData so always save fn values
  - added setFnVals to voFunc to set all ; need some 'dirty' test to improve efficiency
  - fixed bug using ngmin/ngmax not gmin/gmax to display graph min/max in configvo  ??

05 May 2011
  - configTVO: tfDone sets activeField=nil, if not nil when tf_finishEditing then [tfDone:activeField] (fix tap next field not saving changed val)
  - voNumber: typo in setOptDictDflts, was setting nswll not nswl
  - voState: typo in (super) setOptDictDflts, was setting autoscale=dflt if graph==nil (fix autoscale not being saved, was actually set dflt after load)
  - voState:transformVO_num - fixed bug reading autostate, again assumed @"0" would test correctly as !autoscale
  - voChoice:segmentedControl - same test error on shrinkb
  - voTextBox:segmentChanged,voGraphSet - same test error on tbhi,tbni,tbnl
  - voTextBox:segmentChanged - release picker view so gets rebuilt (fix bugs on people, history pickers incl crash on switch)
  - added graphTrackerV:doDrawGraph controlling [drawRect] action, so graph not redrawn for return to utc
  - changed trackerObj so fn results (=value) *are* saved,loaded to speed graphing, but issues remain for updating, saving in db

--- check in ---

06 May 2011
  - added CGRects to divide up graph screen

10 May 2011
  - replaced dbg-defs defines with args... forms

13 May 2011
  - finished re-org of graphing to use UIScrollView for zoom etc, separate windows for title, axes.  still need work for axis labels

--- check in ---

18 May 2011
  - finished axis labels
  - tap on y axis label to change vo displayed
  - tap on graph to mark and set tracker date, double tap to clear
  - return to graph with current date marked 
  - factored dpRslt out of datePickerVC to facilitate this

--- check in ---

18 May 2011
  - changed tf fin edit to not call tfDone -- incompatible with vot_choice ????  what was it needed for ????
  - fixed graphing for vot_choice colors, implemented y axis labels for vot_choice

19 May 2011
  - added currVO to gtv class; double line widths for selected vo
  - tbox linecount set maxVal to at least YTICKS to get int vals on y axis labels
  - clean y axis for non-numeric entries

20 May 2011
  - added processingTfDone flag for voChoices and configTVObjVC so tfDone/ctfDone (see 18 may, 05 may) can process multiple events without recursing inadvertently

25 May 2011
  - starting history, names picker indices; default on for names

27 May 2011
  - finished history, names picker indices.

--- check in ---

08 June 2011
  - modified name picker & ndx to use ABRecordCopyCompositeName if ABRecordCopyValue(sortProp) gets nil result - e.g. sortProp=firstname and record is company

03 August 2011
  - added icon.png
  - fixed private/dismiss label on rootview privacy button label not returned to private on cancel from create pass
  - limit privacy setting for val or tracker to current privacy level: trkrs/valobjs don't disappear, easier than disable priv setting when no password
  --- seems basically done?

--- check in ---

08 August 2011
  - change colors to gray for privacy stuff; still want some curves
  - somehow set privacy for blank tt... privacy set to 0 on start priv then quit...

14 September 2011
  - [setPrivacyValue:tictacvalue] scaled to +MINPRIV to solve problem above
  - made < and > shift through tictacvalues take to min, max set value if before or after min,max

01 October 2011
  - renamed rTracker-Info.plist to Info.plist
