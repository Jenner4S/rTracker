  - moved to macbook pro, though not ssd yet.
  - after refactoring and migrating svn repository, privacy subview working again
  - fixed bug in re-ordering valobjs in a tracker, must check if toRow > array count
  - bug in fn defn, somehow not updating ep ids? ... should add to updateVORefs, recheck also fn setup fix for crash 13/01

02 feb 2011
  - can draw privacy view, tictacview
  - shifted line drawing routine defns to gfx.h
  - added this file to scm

02 mar 2011
  - set, change privacy val all in place, not yet used by tracker display
  
--- check in ---

11 mar -plane to uk-
  - initial export xls working, can open file and write data for each tracker and valobj
  - privacy view restriction implemented for both tracker and value level
  
--- check in ---

21 Mar 2011
  - switch to xcode 4
  - instead of .xls implement .csv
  - moved export button from configTList to useTracker when save not pending
  - minor refactoring to fix 'analyze' issues

22 Mar 2011
  - refactored so access of vo.value triggers [vos update] causing function update, result string set
  - initial csv output working, need to check formatting for input

23 Mar 2011
  - testing, minor bug fixes

24 Mar 2011
  - found bug where fn ep not set to default after load, refactored to make vos' handle clean and set default for optdict
  - optdict defaults now handled in voState objs
  - added voState update(), only active for fn to re-calc .value on read

25 Mar 2011
  - factored out doc, db path creation to (new) rtracker-resource.m
  - option on del tracker to just del data
  - added CSVParser class from Matt Gallagher
  - csv input working -- can't yet save/restore schema
  - default privacy = 1 or can't differentiate priv=0 / not found on load csv
  - TrkrData store min privacy level for date valobjs
  - trying to fix flicker on updatetableview; fixed choice ok, slider broken

26 Mar 2011
  - reverted flicker changes (*check in more often!!*) except for choice 
  - show historical actively would not have enable checkbox on slider, choice; why not? changed

--- check in ---

26 Mar 2011
  - rationalize min/max/big/default privacy values. min for tictac setting is MINPRIV+1

28 Mar 2011
  - flicker fix is to not re-alloc vo displays constantly; fixed messed up slider to get spurious val=0 actions on table reload data
  - changed table reloadData for val changed to just reload fn cells
  - tweak display of slider value for checkbox dis/enable
  - choice value +1 so disabled=0, all selections are positive value
  - voNumber startwithlast picks previous entry by current tracker date, not just last by date
  - start cleaning up NSLog's - need #if debug control

30 Mar 2011
  - tracked down problem in slider to check for useVO on [update], caused wipe of data to set useVO
  + need to clean up either enableVO/disableVO everywhere, or get rid of unused checkbuttonusevo

--- check in ---

  - fixed a memory leak - setVtypes
  + need way to control debug NSLog()s but only option seems to be #if DEBUG wrappers...

31 Mar 2011
  - converted all NSLog to #if DEBUG... controlled 

--- check in ---

09 April 2011
  - error because choice value +1 => not voDisplay'd correctly : added getSegmentIndexForValue routine
  --> bug appearance was all subviews buggered after segmentedControl set to invalid index
  - further complexity: UIControlEventValueCHanged gen'd when val set, not just when user activates -- but slider not this way!
  - privacy cancel from setpass triggered toptf resignfirstresponder, same as setp -> set pass to ""; fixed by rewrite setp, cancelp
  - assuming not null autoscale (= not default) meant errors in graph scale - fixed -- TODO: search for more of these

10 April 2011
  - fixed problem shrinking choice buttons, width was reset when style set.  TODO: seg control needs to be centered in subview in this case

--- check in ---

13 April 2011
  - fixed crash on delete new vo in new tracker - tdb=null
  - fixed bug where kybd notification listen turned on/off in configtvobjvc viewDid(Un)load -- switched to viewWill(Dis)Appear -- so was handling in 2 places
  - moved keyboardIsShown to rtracker-resource so just 1

--- check in ---

13 April 2011
  - fixed bug not clearing text field for number entry if val == @""

14 April 2011
  - fixed bug fnCalcValueFromCurrent post-inc ndx on read, inc again if process token for value so missed + in 's + s2'

--- check in ---

27 April 2011
  - (previous) comments, work out pre/post/sum workings
  - fix problem deleting vo from tracker that had no data stored (e.g. function)

29 April 2011
  - working on shifting transformVO's into voState's from graphTrackerV, then get voFunction to set its values[]

04 May 2011
  - changed saveData so always save fn values
  - added setFnVals to voFunc to set all ; need some 'dirty' test to improve efficiency
  - fixed bug using ngmin/ngmax not gmin/gmax to display graph min/max in configvo  ??

05 May 2011
  - configTVO: tfDone sets activeField=nil, if not nil when tf_finishEditing then [tfDone:activeField] (fix tap next field not saving changed val)
  - voNumber: typo in setOptDictDflts, was setting nswll not nswl
  - voState: typo in (super) setOptDictDflts, was setting autoscale=dflt if graph==nil (fix autoscale not being saved, was actually set dflt after load)
  - voState:transformVO_num - fixed bug reading autostate, again assumed @"0" would test correctly as !autoscale
  - voChoice:segmentedControl - same test error on shrinkb
  - voTextBox:segmentChanged,voGraphSet - same test error on tbhi,tbni,tbnl
  - voTextBox:segmentChanged - release picker view so gets rebuilt (fix bugs on people, history pickers incl crash on switch)
  - added graphTrackerV:doDrawGraph controlling [drawRect] action, so graph not redrawn for return to utc
  - changed trackerObj so fn results (=value) *are* saved,loaded to speed graphing, but issues remain for updating, saving in db

10 May 2011

18 May 2011
  - changed tf fin edit to not call tfDone -- incompatible with vot_choice ????  what was it needed for ????
  - fixed graphing for vot_choice colors, implemented y axis labels for vot_choice

19 May 2011
  - added currVO to gtv class; double line widths for selected vo
  - tbox linecount set maxVal to at least YTICKS to get int vals on y axis labels
  - clean y axis for non-numeric entries

20 May 2011
  - added processingTfDone flag for voChoices and configTVObjVC so tfDone/ctfDone (see 18 may, 05 may) can process multiple events without recursing inadvertently

25 May 2011

27 May 2011

  - added icon.png

17 februrary cont
 - add tracker plists for Attitude, Car, Exercise, Sleep, Weight\ stats, Menus\ \&\ Guests

18 feburary 2012
 - disable userinteraction, navbar btns when loading and exporting files

19 february
 - add preferences bundle for reload sample trackers and reset password
 - working on privacy view still!

21 february
 - FINALLY solved problem of privacy / password views all over;
 problem was race condition between init privacyV and completion of
 parent UITableViewController layout.  Solution was to delay
 instantiation of privacy view until needed, then parent frame not
 changing before frame actually comes up.

--- commit ---

22 february
 - finished implementation of reset password pref
 - located sample tracker files, next step loading ...

23 february
 - fixed ? multiple entry on refreshView() due to skipped name
 duplicate _in.plist; used flag for lock, nonatomic, race vulnerable
 but seems like lots of time to spare -- perhaps delete skipped
 _in.plist ?

25 february
 - implemented atomic test-and-set flags to control refresh and
 recalculateFns thread routines so not re-entered while running
 - made circle primitive move back to center so dotsLines should look
 better
 - load sample plists according to prefs

 - fix rvc:scrollState to allow scroll if privacyObj not yet
 instantiated
 - set ppwV to hidden in hide() as otherwise comes up on scroll
