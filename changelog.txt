  - moved to macbook pro, though not ssd yet.
  - after refactoring and migrating svn repository, privacy subview working again

  - bug in fn defn, somehow not updating ep ids? ... should add to updateVORefs, recheck also fn setup fix for crash 13/01

02 feb 2011
  - can draw privacy view, tictacview

--- check in ---

11 mar -plane to uk-
  - initial export xls working, can open file and write data for each tracker and valobj
  - privacy view restriction implemented for both tracker and value level
  
--- check in ---

21 Mar 2011
  - switch to xcode 4
  - instead of .xls implement .csv
  - moved export button from configTList to useTracker when save not pending
  - minor refactoring to fix 'analyze' issues

22 Mar 2011
  - refactored so access of vo.value triggers [vos update] causing function update, result string set
  - initial csv output working, need to check formatting for input

23 Mar 2011
  - testing, minor bug fixes

24 Mar 2011
  - found bug where fn ep not set to default after load, refactored to make vos' handle clean and set default for optdict
  - optdict defaults now handled in voState objs
  - added voState update(), only active for fn to re-calc .value on read

25 Mar 2011
  - factored out doc, db path creation to (new) rtracker-resource.m
  - option on del tracker to just del data
  - added CSVParser class from Matt Gallagher
  - csv input working -- can't yet save/restore schema
  - default privacy = 1 or can't differentiate priv=0 / not found on load csv
  - TrkrData store min privacy level for date valobjs
  - trying to fix flicker on updatetableview; fixed choice ok, slider broken

26 Mar 2011
  - reverted flicker changes (*check in more often!!*) except for choice 
  - show historical actively would not have enable checkbox on slider, choice; why not? changed

26 Mar 2011
  - rationalize min/max/big/default privacy values. min for tictac setting is MINPRIV+1

28 Mar 2011
  - flicker fix is to not re-alloc vo displays constantly; fixed messed up slider to get spurious val=0 actions on table reload data
  - changed table reloadData for val changed to just reload fn cells
  - tweak display of slider value for checkbox dis/enable
  - choice value +1 so disabled=0, all selections are positive value
  - voNumber startwithlast picks previous entry by current tracker date, not just last by date
  - start cleaning up NSLog's - need #if debug control

30 Mar 2011
  - tracked down problem in slider to check for useVO on [update], caused wipe of data to set useVO
  + need to clean up either enableVO/disableVO everywhere, or get rid of unused checkbuttonusevo

--- check in ---

  - fixed a memory leak - setVtypes
  + need way to control debug NSLog()s but only option seems to be #if DEBUG wrappers...

31 Mar 2011
  - converted all NSLog to #if DEBUG... controlled

09 April 2011
  - error because choice value +1 => not voDisplay'd correctly : added getSegmentIndexForValue routine
  --> bug appearance was all subviews buggered after segmentedControl set to invalid index
  - further complexity: UIControlEventValueCHanged gen'd when val set, not just when user activates -- but slider not this way!
  - privacy cancel from setpass triggered toptf resignfirstresponder, same as setp -> set pass to ""; fixed by rewrite setp, cancelp
  - assuming not null autoscale (= not default) meant errors in graph scale - fixed -- TODO: search for more of these

10 April 2011
  - fixed problem shrinking choice buttons, width was reset when style set.  TODO: seg control needs to be centered in subview in this case
